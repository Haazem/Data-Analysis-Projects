* Before becoming members,

	* Customer A spent $25 on 2 items.

###
###
### 9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier — how many points would each customer have?

```sql
SELECT s.customer_id,
	   SUM(	
		   CASE WHEN m.product_name = 'sushi' THEN 2*10*m.price
				ELSE 10*m.price END
		  )as total_points
FROM dannys_diner.sales s 
JOIN dannys_diner.menu m 
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY total_points DESC;

```

###
###
### 10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi — how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

```sql
SELECT s.customer_id,
	   SUM(
		   CASE WHEN m.product_name = 'sushi' THEN 2*10*m.price
				WHEN s.order_date >= mb.join_date AND 
					 s.order_date < DATEADD(WEEK , 1 , mb.join_date)
				THEN 2*10*m.price
				ELSE 10*m.price END
		  )as total_points

FROM dannys_diner.sales s 
JOIN dannys_diner.menu m 
ON s.product_id = m.product_id
JOIN dannys_diner.members mb
ON mb.customer_id = s.customer_id
WHERE s.order_date <= '2021-01-31'
GROUP BY s.customer_id;

```
