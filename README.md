# Explore US Bikeshare Data 

In this project, i make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

Python script to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files - contain the same core six (6) columns:
- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
- Gender
- Birth Year

- most common end station.
- most common trip from start to end.

# 3 Trip duration
- total travel time
- average travel time

# 4 User info
- counts of each user type
